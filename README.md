I create and share digital tools with passion and purpose.

There’s absolutely no pressure to donate, but if my work has been helpful to you, any contribution is sincerely appreciated.

Your support goes directly toward upgrading my PC and developing more free scripts for everyone.

Thank you for your support! ❤️ https://ko-fi.com/riversafe33

This script allows you to perform animations when using an animal ped.

The menu automatically detects the animal ped you are using and offers animations that match the animal.

It includes 97 preconfigured animals and the option to add more via config.lua.

The menu can be opened using the /animalmenu command, which can be changed in the config.lua file if desired.
